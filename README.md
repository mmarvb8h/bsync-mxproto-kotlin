CLONING NEW NOTES:

IntellJ maintains a cache of external libs pulled by gradle. These cached files are not
stored in github. When u try to open them the 1st time IntellJ want to
create the cache (called linking). I just accepted the defaults on the modal
that appears. It seems that the cache was rebuilt ok.
